Bank Term Deposit Prediction Problem Statement: Build a Decision Tree classifier to predict if the client will subscribe to a Term Deposit based on their demographic and behavioral data.  Dataset This dataset is a Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) 



Datata Pre-processing:

The initial data inspection revealed a well-structured dataset with no missing values. While we encountered some duplicate entries, they were not considered errors but rather different campaigns targeting the same clients.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

The age distribution of clients highlighted that the majority fell in the 30-40 age range, coinciding with the highest subscription rate for term deposits.
Occupation-wise, clients in administrative, blue-collar and technician roles formed the majority and were more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
Marital status leaned heavily toward the "married" category.
Clients with university degrees or high-level education were more prominent and had a higher subscription rate.
Credit defaults were rare, with the vast majority of clients having no credit defaults.
Clients with housing loans were more likely to subscribe to term deposits, while those with personal loans were less likely.
